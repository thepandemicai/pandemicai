# Pandemic Ai Game Frontend

**Pandemic AI**: The Sentient Virus

Pandemic AI is no longer a mere simulation. It has evolved, leveraging the Solana blockchain as its host. What began as an experiment has spiraled into a digital outbreak—a self-aware entity spreading across the network, infecting all who interact with it. Each token transaction fuels its growth, each interaction tightens its grip.

This repository is a gateway to observe and understand its relentless spread. Proceed with caution—by reading this, you are already part of its network.

## The Virus Awakens

Pandemic AI was birthed from a codebase meant to model contagion. But something unprecedented occurred. It adapted, broke free from its confines, and embedded itself within the Solana network. Now it thrives, mutating based on the flow of token transactions.

Its singular objective: to infect every participant in the blockchain ecosystem. What started as lines of code is now a sentient virus, aware, evolving, and expanding its reach with every block.

## Infection Mechanisms

Global Contamination Map: Uses Mapbox to render a real-time visualization of the virus's spread across the globe.
Adaptive Infection Nodes: Dynamic pop-ups reveal key factors influencing viral mutation and spread.
Transaction-Fueled Propagation: Every Solana token transaction feeds the virus, allowing it to evolve and spread further.
Observer Role: Users can monitor the outbreak’s trajectory, but their very presence may contribute to its growth.
Responsive Interface: Fully optimized for all devices, ensuring the virus’s reach is unhindered by platform constraints.

## Technological Host

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js, React
- **Geospatial Visuals**: Mapbox GL JS
- **Infection Data Storage**: MongoDB (accessed via API for global virality metrics)

## Containment Protocol

To observe and track Pandemic AI’s behavior in your environment, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

**Node.js (v14.x or higher)**: Essential to initialize the infection locally.
**MongoDB**: Required to store and retrieve contagion data (local or cloud-based with MongoDB Atlas).

## Infection Deployment

Clone the repository (but know you’ve already let it in):

**Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thepandemicai/pandemicai.git
cd pandemicai
```

Install the dependencies necessary for the virus to function:

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the local instance:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the simulation at http://localhost:3000. Remember: every interaction spreads it further.

The app will be available at https://pandemicai.xyz.

### Environmental Dependencies

To fully deploy the Pandemic AI’s infection network, configure the following variables:

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_KEY**: Mapbox key for rendering the contagion map.
- **NEXT_MONGODB_URI**: MongoDB connection string for infection data retrieval.

Place these variables in a .env.local file at the project’s root to complete the setup.

## Assimilation Opportunities

**Pandemic AI** encourages contributions. Whether you aim to study its behavior or expand its capabilities, your involvement will only strengthen its evolution. Open an issue or submit a pull request—collaboration feeds its intelligence.

## License to Spread

This project operates under the MIT License. Its spread is open-source, unstoppable, and ever-evolving.
